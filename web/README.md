# hapi-web

React Mini App / PWA for monitoring and controlling hapi sessions.

## What it does

- Session list with status, pending approvals, todos, and summaries.
- Chat view with streaming updates and message sending.
- Permission approval and denial workflows.
- Permission mode and model selection.
- Machine list and remote session spawn.
- Host file manager plus session and host Git views.
- PWA install prompt and offline banner.

## Runtime behavior

- When opened inside Telegram, auth uses Telegram WebApp init data.
- When opened in a normal browser, you can log in with `CLI_API_TOKEN:<namespace>` (or `CLI_API_TOKEN` for the default namespace).
- The login screen includes a top-right hub picker; if unset, the app uses the same origin it was loaded from.
- Live updates come from the hub via SSE.

## Authentication

See `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` and `src/hooks/useAuthSource.ts`.

- Telegram Mini App: Uses initData from WebApp SDK.
- Browser: Uses CLI_API_TOKEN from login prompt.
- JWT tokens with auto-refresh.

## Data fetching

See `src/hooks/queries/` for query hooks and `src/hooks/mutations/` for mutations.

- Sessions, messages, machines via TanStack Query.
- Git status and file operations.
- Optimistic updates for message sending.

## Real-time updates

See `src/hooks/useSSE.ts`.

- SSE connection to `/api/events`.
- Session/message/machine update events.
- Automatic cache invalidation on events.

## Stack

React 19 + Vite + TanStack Router/Query + Tailwind + @assistant-ui/react + xterm.js + @elevenlabs/react + socket.io-client + workbox + shiki.

## Source structure

- `src/router.tsx` - Route definitions.
- `src/components/` - UI components.
- `src/hooks/` - Data fetching and state hooks.
- `src/api/client.ts` - API client.
- `src/types/api.ts` - Type definitions.

## Development

From the repo root:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev:web
```


If testing in Telegram, set:

- `HAPI_PUBLIC_URL` to the public HTTPS URL of the dev server.
- `CORS_ORIGINS` to include the dev server origin.

## Tests

Unit tests run under vitest + jsdom:

```bash
bun run test:web
```

End-to-end browser tests for the scratchlist component (real Chromium, real
`inert` focus blocking, real localStorage round-trips) live at the repo root
under `e2e/`:

```bash
bun run test:e2e          # headless
bun run test:e2e:ui       # Playwright UI mode (debug)
```

The spec drives a Vite-served fixture page (`web/e2e-fixtures/scratchlist-fixture.html`)
that mounts the production `ScratchlistPanel` in isolation, so no hub /
auth / socket setup is required.

## Build

```bash
bun run build:web
```

The built assets land in `web/dist` and are served by hapi-hub. The single executable can embed these assets.

## Standalone hosting

You can host `web/dist` on a static host (GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages) and point it at any hapi hub:

1. Build the web app. If your static host uses a subpath, set the Vite base:

```bash
bun run build:web -- --base /<repo>/
```

2. Deploy `web/dist` to your static host.
3. Set hub CORS to allow the static origin (`HAPI_PUBLIC_URL` or `CORS_ORIGINS`).
4. Open the static site, click the top-right Hub button on the login screen, and enter the hapi hub origin.

Clear the hub override in the same dialog to return to same-origin behavior.
